# pixo Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **pixo**, a minimal-dependency, high-performance image compression library written in Rust.

This documentation is designed to be accessible to developers who may not be familiar with the low-level details of image compression. We use clear explanations, visual examples, and step-by-step breakdowns to help you understand not just _how_ these algorithms work, but _why_ they work.

**API docs (with embedded guides):** build locally with `cargo doc --all-features --open` or view on docs.rs once published (`docs.rs/pixo`).
